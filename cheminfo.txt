BASIC CHEMISTRY INFORMATION

Introduction:
The information given herewith should provide some basic chemistry information to help you when using the chemistry calculator mobile application.

Measurements:
1 cubic decimeter(dm3) = 1000 cubic centimeters(cm3)
1 cubic decimeter(dm3) = 1 litre (l) 

Volumetric Analysis (Molarity):
This is the chemical procedure of determining the concentration of a solution. The concentration of a solution is the mass of solute
per cubic decimeter of solution (g/dm3). In another definition it is the amount of moles of a solution.
Molarity is the concentration of a solution expressed in mol/dm3.
A standard solution is a solution of known concentration. It is used in volumetric analysis (acid/base titrations) to determine amount 
of solute in a solution or its molarity.

Gas Laws:
Standard temperature and pressure(S.T.P): It is a reference point for expressing the properties of ideal gases. The standard temperature
is the freezing point of water i.e. zero degrees celsius or 273 kelvin. The standard pressure is one atmosphere (760mmHg or 100 kPa).
The volume of one mole of an ideal gas at S.T.P is 22.4 dm3(litres).
Four variables are used to state the condition of a gas:
    -Temperature
    -Pressure
    -Volume
    -Quantity of matter in moles

Boyle's Law: Its relates the volume and the pressure of a gas at constant temperature. The law states that for a fixed mass of a
gas the volume is inversely proportional to its pressure (kelvin) provided temperature remains constant.

Charles' Law: Its relates the volume and the temperature of a gas at constant pressure. The law states that for a fixed mass of a
gas the volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (kelvin) provided pressure remains constant.

Molar Volume of a gas:
It is one mole of any ideal gas occupies 22.4dm3 of standard temperature and pressure (S.T.P) or 24.0dm3 at room temperature and
pressure(R.T.P)
